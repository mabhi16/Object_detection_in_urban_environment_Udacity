# Object Detection in an Urban Environment

## Project overview

The main problem statement of this project is to achieve 2D object detection in an urban environment. Objects under consideration for detection are vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Object detection plays an important part in the self-driving car system as it mainly helps in collision avoidance and maneuver planning.

## Data

For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/).

[OPTIONAL] - The files can be downloaded directly from the website as tar files or from the [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/) as individual tf records. We have already provided the data required to finish this project in the workspace, so you don't need to download it separately.

## Structure

### Data

The data you will use for training, validation and testing is organized as follow:
```
/home/workspace/data/waymo
    - training_and_validation - contains 97 files to train and validate your models
    - train: contain the train data (empty to start)
    - val: contain the val data (empty to start)
    - test - contains 3 files to test your model and create inference videos

### Setup

Tf Object Detection API relies on config files. The config that we will use for this project is pipeline.config, which is the config for a SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model. 
Initialy download the pretrained model and move it to /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/. 

which can be achieved by by given instruction below:

cd /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/

wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz

tar -xvzf ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz

rm -rf ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz

later We need to edit the config files to change the location of the training and validation files, as well as the location of the label_map file, pretrained weights. We also need to adjust the batch size. To do so, run the following:

cd /home/workspace/

python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 2 --checkpoint /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map /home/workspace/experiments/label_map.pbtxt

A new config file called pipeline_new.config will be created in the /home/workspace/ directory. Move this file to the /home/workspace/experiments/reference/ directory using 

mv pipeline_new.config /home/workspace/experiements/reference/

Now we can start training process by executing below instruction

python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config
